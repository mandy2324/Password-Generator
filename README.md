# Password Generator

This week’s homework requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. 

This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
